 ## ABSTRACT

Netflix is the most widely used media and video streaming platform. It has around 200 million users World Wide. It offers a large library of movies and TV series that can be accessed at any time via internet services. Netflix works on a subscription based model , where users get unlimited access to content with a paid subscription and users can cancel their subscription whenever they want that’s why Netflix always needs to provide the best content to retain their subscriber because of this, it's essential to have a recommendation system that gives customers helpful suggestions.

This dataset consists of TV shows and movies available on Netflix as of 2019. The dataset is collected from Flixable which is a third-party Netflix search engine.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
In 2018, they released an interesting report which shows that the number of TV shows on Netflix has nearly tripled since 2010. Thestreaming service’s number of movies has decreased by more than 2,000 titles since 2010, while its number of TV shows has nearly tripled. It will be interesting to explore what all other insights can be obtained from the same dataset.

## In this project, you are required to do

1: Exploratory Data Analysis .

2: Understanding what type content is available in different countries .

3: Is Netflix has increasingly focusing on TV rather than movies in recent years.

4: Clustering similar content by matching text-based features .
